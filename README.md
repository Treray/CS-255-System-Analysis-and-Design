# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project aimed to create a web-based system that helps students prepare for and schedule their driving lessons and tests. The client, DriverPass, wanted a platform where users could access online courses, book driving lessons, take practice tests, and make secure payments. The system also needed to support administrators and instructors by providing tools for managing users, scheduling lessons, and tracking student progress.I excelled in creating clear and organized UML diagrams, including use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, which clearly outlined how the system would function. I also made sure to address security issues, system limitations, and user-friendly design principles in my documentation and presentation.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

For the business requirements document, I would make changes to different sections to add more details. This would improve clarity and ensure that all system functions are clearly defined and meet the client's needs. Expanding on user roles, security measures, and system limitations would help everyone understand how the system will work. Adding real-world examples and specific implementation details would make the document more useful for developers and stakeholders.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed the DriverPass interview transcript and the business requirements document to understand what the user needs. The client wanted an easy to use web-based system where students can schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and make secure payments. It should also let administrators and instructors manage lessons, monitor student progress, and handle account management. I showed these needs through clear use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and a simple class diagram, so each user role has clear actions within the system. It’s important to consider user needs because the system must be simple, efficient, and accessible to everyone. If the system doesn’t meet user expectations, it might lead to low adoption rates, usability problems, and added complications. By focusing on user needs, I made sure that DriverPass offers a smooth and functional user experience while keeping security and efficiency in mind.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When I design software, I follow a clear process. First, I gather requirements by identifying what users need. I break these needs into functional and nonfunctional parts. Next, I create diagrams like use case, activity, and class diagrams to organize the system visually. In the future, I plan to use more prototyping techniques. This will give stakeholders early visual examples of the system. I will also use user testing methods like wireframing and usability testing to get feedback before completing the design. I aim to use agile methods, where I test and refine small updates regularly. This will help ensure the final product is flexible and meets changing user needs.
